# MinePad
This is the repository for my Minecraft server software (and proxy software) that’s 100% written in Apple’s programming’s language Swift.

MinePad will be available for all Minecraft PE versions starting with 1.2.0 (Better Together Update). The newest Beta versions (currently 1.19.30.20).
It will also be available for Java Edition in a future update.

NOTE: If you don't have connection to your MinePad server, please check if the port number in the Serverconfig.yml file is opened on your router.
