# MinePad
This is the repository for my Minecraft server software (and proxy software) that’s 100% written in Apple’s programming’s language Swift.

MinePad will be available for all Minecraft PE versions starting with 1.20.0 (Trails & Tales Update).
It will also be available for Java Edition in a future update.

NOTE: If you don't have connection to your MinePad server, please check if the port number in the Serverconfig.yml file is opened on your router.
